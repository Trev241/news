TTC service changes starting Sunday
Several changes to TTC service beginning this Sunday.
Starting Sunday the TTC is changing bus service on several key routes and returning streetcar service to Broadview Station.
In a news release issued Friday, the transit company said it is increasing capacity and frequency on the 29 Dufferin route on Saturday nights.
“Saturday evening service on the busy 29 Dufferin route will be more frequent with increased capacity,” TTC said, adding that buses will run every five minutes between 7 to 10 p.m. on Saturdays. 
Other bus routes that will see increased service at various times include, 41 Keele, 125 Drewry, 935 Jane Express, 941 Keele Express and 960 Steeles West Express. Routes that will see less frequent buses at certain times include 17 Birchmount and 900 Airport Express.
Commuters are advised to refer to the TTC website for details on the full service adjustments beginning Sunday.
Meanwhile, streetcar service to Broadview Station will resume again this Sunday with the return of 504 King, 505 Dundas and overnight services.
“This completes a co-ordinated project between the City of Toronto, Toronto Water, and the TTC to renew and upgrade important infrastructure in the area,” the TTC said.
Also, as a result of work beginning to replace certain water mains and streetcar tracks along King Street West, between Shaw and Dufferin, service in the area on the 63 Ossington, 501 Queen, 504/304 King and 508 Lake Shore routes will be affected. 
TTC has released a video outlining the changes. The transit company said work is expected to be completed by December.
